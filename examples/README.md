# Gleam by Example

## Directory structure

This directory is created using the `gleam new examples` command.

The `src` directory contains code snippets and explaination for all examples on the website.

The `test` directory contains tests for the code snippets

## File structure

First three lines are module documentation (`////`) where each line conveys the example's details

1. Order number
2. Title
3. Description

Module documentation is followed by the code for the example. Finally, we have regular comments (`//`) at the end of the file, indicating the shell output for running the code.
