## Overview

The code examples are in [`examples/src`](https://github.com/alabhyajindal/gleambyexample/tree/main/examples/src) directory. Each Gleam file contains the code example's title, description, code and the output for running the code. All in a single file!

[`examples/test`](https://github.com/alabhyajindal/gleambyexample/tree/main/examples/test) contains tests for the code examples.

## Examples

Each example file has a similar structure.

First three lines are module documentation and convey the example's details:

1. Example number
2. Title
3. Description

Module documentation is followed by the code example. Finally, we have regular comments, indicating a shell session for running the code.

## Editing

Please open a PR if you see an example that could be written better! This includes changing the example, title or description.

## Adding

Please open a PR if you want to add an example that you think could be useful.
